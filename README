- qmk_firmware is managed as a git subtree
- For the submodules inside qmk_firmware, I copied the .gitmodules from
  qmk_firmware in the root directory, and fixed the paths. (git modules must
  be defined in the root of the repository).

To build:

    docker-compose run json2c
    docker-compose run build

To flash (do this on both halves, when asking for reset, Fn1+2-esc)

    docker-compose run flash
