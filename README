- qmk_firmware is managed as a git subtree
- For the submodules inside qmk_firmware, I copied the .gitmodules from
  qmk_firmware in the root directory, and fixed the paths. (git modules must
  be defined in the root of the repository).

To build:

    docker-compose run build

To flash:

    docker-compose run flash
